			<p class="number">My Student ID is 101212259</p>

			<p class="course">
				I am a third year student of Swinburne University of Technology Sarawak Campus, who is pursuing Bachelor of Engineering (Robotics and Mechatronics) (Honours) / Bachelor of Computer Science.</p>
			
			<p class= "interests">
				I am a female Chinese, born in the year 1999. As of this December, I will be turning 21 years old. 
				The current daily routine of my lifestyle heavily involves
				the following: eat, sleep, attend church, attend online classes, and study.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				According the the 16 Personalities test, I am an INFP.
				(<strong>I</strong>troverted, 
				<strong>I</strong>ntuitive, 
				<strong>F</strong>eeling 
				and <strong>P</strong>rospecting).</p>
				
			<p class="hometown">
				I am born in Miri, Sarawak. However, I do not consider that my hometown. 
				The sleepy town of Lawas, Sarawak, the place where my grandparents had left for to escape the war, is where my hometown is.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				My fondest memory of Lawas is of waking up before the sun rises in the early morning, to walk with my mother to the morning market.
				The atmosphere of the morning markets, especially on the weekends, never fail to fascinate me. I love seeing vendors and their items for sale,
				and I enjoy just being in the midst of people going about leisurely, others not so, on a Saturday morning. Common things I have come to identify with my memories 
				of the Lawas town market are: bright, colourful umbrella stands, yellow bananas and green mangoes, bright red rambutans. 
				Then there are also the display of <em>kuehs</em>, traditional Malay and Chinese delicacies which I have slowly grown to appreciate; 
				colorful sugared drinks, and the oily smell of fried foodstuffs which would permeate the air. All these, and so much more, 
				are my memories associated with the Lawas town market. 
				<br/>
				<br/>
				However, Lawas is not where I grew up. Usually when prompted, I will say I come from Brunei-- and that much is true.
				After all, it is the place where I was raised. Brunei, short for Brunei Darussalam, is a country of its own. Aptly named "The Abode of Peace", 
				it is indeed a peaceful place, a hidden gem located on the lush island of Borneo. Brunei has four districts, and a population of almost 450 thousand people.
				A small country indeed, but rich in natural resources-- most notably oil. 70 percent of the country also remains an untouched rainforest.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				Many people would say that, for a country, <em>"Brunei so boring! Nothing there one la!"</em>. 
				While I do admit that that much is true, this requires another perspective to see the country: 
				Since Brunei is first and foremost an Islamic country, thus their culture does not allow for nightclubs or bars, nor any kind of nightlife. However, 
				there <em>are</em> cinemas, and men and women are allowed to sit together, despite common misconceptions.
				Nevertheless, I believe that nightlife entertainment are not all that there is to life.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				The uniqueness of Brunei, in my opinion, lies not in its entertainment, nor its tourist attractions (although Brunei does have some pretty good places 
				for the common traveller to experience), but rather, in its people. Unfortunately, this is often overlooked as people are more often drawn to large and 
				fun activities, or interesting places, rather than just slowing down to take in the atmosphere and the culture of a country.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				In a way, when in Brunei, to experience the full uniqueness of the country, one should learn to take life as if it is a leisure stroll. 
				For such is the way how things are in Brunei: relaxed. The people are laidback, kind and friendly-- you are more likely to have a local come up and ask if 
				you need a ride to town, than be robbed while walking the streets in Brunei. That's just one out of the few notable things one would learn while in Brunei.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				Brunei Darussalam, the Abode of Peace-- for me to summarize it into three words, it would be, just, simply be "a good place".
			</p>

			<p class="hobbies">
				There are many things which I enjoy. A notable few are: reading, photography, and singing.
				I also love playing with my pet cat whenever I go home during the holidays. 
			</p>

			<p class="interests">Most of my interests coincide with my hobbies. My other interests are: learning new things, composing and building.</p>
